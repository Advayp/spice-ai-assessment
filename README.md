# Cricket Sports Analytics Tool

## What is this?

This repository should serve as the backend for a tool that helps coaches (specifically those for the sport cricket) analyze their players' performance and help them improve.

Here's how it does this:

1. The backend stores all players' performance with respect to some user. This user is the coach. Any retrieval is done with respect to some user, so that every coach can access only their data
2. Using Spice AI's support for Retrieval-Augment-Generation (RAG), the backend enables users to ask complex questions in natural language about their data. This can be especially powerful in a coaching setting where, when creating plans, sifting through heaps of data or writing complex SQL queries is to cumbersome. Using natural language and Spice's support for RAG, this backend simplifies searching for relevant data significantly.
3. This backend also implements vectorized searching through the `notes` entry tied to each score in the database. A coach can search through this column and find when a particular player has performed in a given way in the past quickly. With vectorization, I ensure that results similar to those requested are provided too, effectively going above and beyond in matching the coach's query.

## Setup

**Installations and API Setup**:

- Create a project with Supabase
- Ensure you have an OPEN AI Key
- Install the spice runtime on your system
- Ensure `cargo` is installed

**Environment Setup**: After cloning this repo, ensure your `.env` file looks the following:

```
SUPABASE_KEY=<API KEY LISTED ON SUPABASE>
PROJECT_REF=<AS LISTED ON SUPABASE>
PG_HOST=<HOST LISTED ON SUPABASE>
PG_PORT=<PORT LISTED ON SUPABASE>
PG_USER=<USER LISTED ON SUPABASE>
PG_PASS=<PASSWORD TO PG DB ON SUPABASE>
OPENAI_KEY=<YOUR OPENAI KEY>
```

Also ensure that your OpenAI API key is stored as an environment variable on your system.

**Supabase Setup**:

1. Create a table called `scores`
2. Modify the table policies such that any anonymous and authenticated can make changes to the table
3. Create the following additional columns (leaving `id` and `created_at` as is) with the following types:

| Column Name | Type   |
| ----------- | ------ |
| `name`      | `text` |
| `uid`       | `text` |
| `score`     | `int8` |
| `notes`     | `text` |

## Running the Application

1. Run `spice run`
2. In a separate terminal, run `cargo run`. This should start the server on port 8000.
3. That's it! Feel free to make requests to any of the available end points.

## All Routes

See the following section for more details on each of the types referenced in this table.

## Spicepods

For this one project, I chose to use only one `spicepod` as I wanted RAG and vectorization to be linked to one database.
My `spicepod` uses the following features:

1. Data Connector. In my `spicepod`, I setup a Data connector to postgres database that's hosted on Supabase
2. Embeddings. I use [this](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) model to create vectorizations of a particular column in my database, enabling users to search more throughly and quickly.
3. Models. My `spicepod` connects to OpenAI's GPT-4 to allow users to perform complex queries on the database. This enables to find exactly what they're looking by supporting a vast variety of queries.

## Notes and Extensions

- My backend assumes the frontend will handle caching and storing `uid`. This is why nothing regarding this is done on the backend.
- The `created_at` field is stored as a string currently because it's not used as a Date. However, in an extension to this project, one could use Spice's tooling and models supporting time series analysis and allow coaches to predict how well their players are going to do. In this situation, it would make sense to store `created_at` as a date.
